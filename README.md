# End to End tests for K3S

This is a simple repo for testing to make sure I have successfully deployed a k3s cluster.
The idea is to use an E2E framework with BDD processes so that I can eventually maintain core use cases while using TDD.

This is a separate repo because I want to make sure it does not depend on any code from its fixtures.

## Gauge and Taiko

This is an E2E testing framework that can read MD, allowing humad readable specs that are testable.
